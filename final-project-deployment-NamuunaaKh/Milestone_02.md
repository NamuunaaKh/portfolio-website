ðŸ”¬ Research Topic: Connecting a MongoDB Atlas Database Using Mongoose

For my research topic, I explored how to connect a Node.js + Express web application to a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas database using Mongoose. I learned how to:

- Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Set up a database user and IP whitelist to allow connections
- Write a `.env` file to store sensitive credentials securely
- Use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables (learned in class too)
- Use Mongoose to define a schema for contact messages (learned in class too)
- Save form submissions to the database using `ContactMessage.create()` (learned in class too)

This allowed me to build a fully functional contact form that stores user input in the cloud. The app connects to the remote MongoDB server and writes data through a Mongoose model in my backend route.
